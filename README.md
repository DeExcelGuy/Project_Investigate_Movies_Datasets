# Project_Investigate_Movies_Datasets

### Dataset Description
The Movie Database (TMDb) is an online crowdsourced database for movie and television information. Its dataset contains 10,866 movies from 1960 to 2015 and 21 columns including revenue generated and budget allocated for each movie.

### Question(s) for Analysis
The questions to be explored are:

1. Do movies with higher budgets generate more box office revenue?
2. Which movie genres are the most popular over time?

### Processes for Analysis
We are going to import all the packages necessary for our analysis. Such as

1. Pandas to import our data
2. Numpy to analyse our numbers and
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize our data
